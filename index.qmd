We are a group of people interested in rehabilitation research. We believe that rehabilitation should be comprehensive and adaptable to different needs, and that it should include care and attention to each individual's rehabilitation journey.

The majority of our research projects focus on neuro-geriatric rehabilitation. In other words, we work on rehabilitation projects involving older people or people with neurological conditions.

We investigate and design rehabilitation assessments and interventions in various settings. A particular focus of our research unit is evidence synthesis in different rehabilitation settings.

This website provides information on the Care Team and details of ongoing projects.

Should you be a student seeking a potential topic for a Bachelor's or Master's thesis, we would be pleased to hear from you.
